A mobile (iOS/Android) application written in Flutter for controlling LED light strips via infrared (IR) blaster.

The app works out of the box for the 1080 x 2400 resolution, i.e. 20:9 ratio. Other resolutions may need manual adjustment.

(Notice: Code is not optimized as this is a proof of concept. Feel free to fork and improve upon.)
